         <h1> Where I come from </h1>
         <p>My name is Ben. I was born and raised in Wellington New Zealand basically my whole life. In 2012 my family and I moved to Melbourne for a year, I learnt some amazing skills and explored one of the most amazing cities ever. I made many new friends who I didn't want to leave after that year I had with them. I am now studying for a Bachelor of Creative Media Production, focusing towards both animation and film editing. </p>
         <h2>A thriving career</h2>
         <p>I have a huge interest in animations, editing films, while monitoring watching good content by creators to stimulate ideas. Sport is a big part of my life and I always want to be involved with it. 
I have a number of diverse creative abilities, and enjoy expressing those abilities through drawing and through editing videos i make. Whatever it might be, I love to keep practising and pushing myself to improve those skills. 
Growing up with technology has allowed me to become a more creative person. Sometimes on weekends I would get bored and just sit in my room creating things that I had seen on TV shows.
 
Editing short films is a passion of mine as I like to edit videos of my work to help express that to other people.
